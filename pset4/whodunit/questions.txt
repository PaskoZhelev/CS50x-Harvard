1.   Its purpose is to declare sets of integer types having specified widths, and shall define corresponding sets of macros

2.  They define the way that you are going to use the data for your purposes.

3.  BYTE = 8 bits = 1 byte ; DWORD= 32 bits = 4 bytes ; LONG 32 bits = 4 bytes ; WORD = 16 bits = 2 bytes

4.  The first two bytes should be set to the word BM to indicate bitmap. This denotes the bfType. 

5.  bfSize - defines the size of the bitmap file (in bytes)
    biSize - defines the size of the structure (in bytes)
    
6.  If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB (device-independent bitmap)
	with origin - the upper left corner.
	
7.  biBitCount 

8.  An error may occur because the file with that name cannot be found and opened.

9.  fread defines how many elements you want to read and since we are reading struct we need only 1 element.

10. The padding is going to be 3. Since 3 pixels * 3 3 bytes per pixel = 9 bytes. 3 bytes are needed to 12 bytes so it would be multiple to 4.

11. It is used to set the file position of the stream to the given offset.

12. An integer constant which, when used as the whence argument to the fseek or fseeko function,
	specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position
