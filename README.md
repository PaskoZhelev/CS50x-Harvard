# CS50x-Harvard
CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science course by Harvard University

CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. 

Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.

This repository contains all of my solutions to the problem sets as well as the exercise files from the lectures.
